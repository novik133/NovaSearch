Description: Fast system-wide file search for Linux with XFCE4 integration
 NovaSearch provides fast, system-wide file search functionality similar to
 macOS Spotlight. It consists of two main components:
 .
  * An indexing daemon written in Rust that continuously monitors and indexes
    the filesystem using inotify
  * A GTK3-based search panel plugin for XFCE4 that provides a native user
    interface for searching indexed content
 .
 Features:
  * Real-time indexing with filesystem monitoring
  * Fast SQLite-backed search index
  * Native XFCE4 panel integration
  * Configurable include/exclude patterns
  * Minimal resource usage
  * Global keyboard shortcut (default: Super+Space)
